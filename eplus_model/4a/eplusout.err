   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=189_GROUNDFLOOR_0_0_0
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** GetInternalHeatGains: People="PEOPLE 189" has comfort related schedules but no thermal comfort model selected.
   **   ~~~   ** If schedules are specified for air velocity, clothing insulation, and/or work efficiency but no thermal comfort
   **   ~~~   ** thermal comfort model is selected, the schedules will be listed as unused schedules in the .err file.
   **   ~~~   ** To avoid these errors, select a valid thermal comfort model or eliminate these schedules in the PEOPLE input.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design cooling load for zone=LIVING_UNIT is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=MAINS PRESSURE_UNIT1
